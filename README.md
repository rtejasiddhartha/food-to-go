A Responsive Food Ordering Website

Food-To-Go is a fully responsive, visually rich food ordering web application designed for the festive season — allowing customers to pre-order curated meal boxes for Christmas and New Year. Developed with a focus on modern UI/UX standards, this 2025 reimagining of a 2020 project showcases advanced layout design, enhanced interactivity, and seamless cross-device experience.

Christmas & New Year Pre-Ordering:
Order from a wide range of holiday-exclusive boxes including mains, desserts, and party platters.

E-Commerce Product Grid:
Modern card-style product layout with “Add to Cart” interaction and a sliding side cart panel that displays real-time selections and subtotals.

Fully Responsive Design:
Optimized for all screen sizes — from mobile phones and tablets to large desktops — using Tailwind CSS and fluid grid layouts.

Checkout Simulation + Cart Badge Counter:
Cart button updates in real-time with selected items, subtotal calculations, and disabled "Out of Stock" states.

Spark Rewards System:
Users are incentivized with reward points, surprise gifts, and discount unlocks through Spark ID-based purchases.

Reusable Components Across Pages:
Consistent headers, footers, login modal, and navigation stacked smartly for responsive stacking and accessibility.

Help, FAQ, Terms, and Info Pages:
All static pages professionally upgraded to reflect real-world content: return policies, order tracking, delivery schedules, and legal terms.

Enhanced Visual Content:
Includes banners, countdowns, customer testimonials, blog highlights, trending dishes, festive announcements, and downloadable planners.

Optional Login Modal (Future Ready):
Designed for authentication integration, with a clean modal that complements the cart UI.

Project Goal:
To redesign a 2020 holiday food ordering website into a visually modern, device-responsive, user-centered web application using 2025 front-end best practices.
